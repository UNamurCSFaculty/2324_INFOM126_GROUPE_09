documentation and help at https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.0.0.\nThis application was generated using JHipster 8.0.0 and JHipster .Net Core , you can find documentation and help at https://jhipsternet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html and https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.0.0.\nProject Structure\nNode is required for generation and recommended for development. package.json is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.\nIn the project root, JHipster generates configuration files for tools like git, prettier, eslint, husky, and others that are well known and you can find references in the web.\n\n.yo-rc.json - Yeoman configuration file\nJHipster configuration is stored in this file at generator-jhipster key. You may find generator-jhipster-* for specific blueprints configuration.\n.yo-resolve (optional) - Yeoman conflict resolver\nAllows to use a specific action when conflicts are found skipping prompts for files that matches a pattern. Each line should match [pattern] [action] with pattern been a Minimatch pattern and action been one of skip (default if ommited) or force. Lines starting with # are considered comments and are ignored.\n.jhipster/*.json - JHipster entity configuration files\ndocker/ - Docker configurations for the application and services that the application depends on\nsrc/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/ - Web Application folder\n\nDevelopment\nBefore you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:\n\nNode.js: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.\nDepending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.\n\nAfter installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.\nYou will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.\nExample :npm installWe use npm scripts and Angular CLI with Webpack as our build system.\nRun the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser\nauto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.\nExample :./mvnw\nnpm startNpm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by\nspecifying a newer version in package.json. You can also run npm update and npm install to manage dependencies.\nAdd the help flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, npm help update.\nThe npm run command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.\nPWA Support\nJHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.\nThe service worker initialization code is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/app/app.module.ts:\nExample :ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false }),Managing dependencies\nFor example, to add Leaflet library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:\nExample :npm install --save --save-exact leafletTo benefit from TypeScript type definitions from DefinitelyTyped repository in development, you would run following command:\nExample :npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leafletThen you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that Webpack knows about them:\nEdit src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/app/app.module.ts file:\nExample :import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';Edit src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/content/scss/vendor.scss file:\nExample :@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.\nFor further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at Using JHipster in development.\nUsing Angular CLI\nYou can also use Angular CLI to generate some custom client code.\nFor example, the following command:\nExample :ng generate component my-componentwill generate few files:\nExample :create src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html\ncreate src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts\nupdate src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/src/app/app.module.tsBefore you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:\n\nNode.js: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.\nDepending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.\n\nAfter installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.\nYou will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.\nIn ./src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp run\nExample :npm installWe use npm scripts and Webpack as our build system.\nRun the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser\nauto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.\nExample :npm --prefix ./src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp startnpm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by\nspecifying a newer version in package.json. You can also run npm update and npm install to manage dependencies.\nAdd the help flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, npm help update.\nThe npm --prefix ./src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp run command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.\nBuilding for production\n.Net Production builds\nTo build the artifacts and optimize the PipelineTFM application for production, run:\nExample :cd ./src/PipelineTFM\nrm -rf ./src/PipelineTFM/wwwroot\ndotnet publish --verbosity normal -c Release -o ./app/out ./PipelineTFM.csprojThe ./src/PipelineTFM/app/out directory will contain your application dll and its depedencies.\nTesting\nClient tests\nUnit tests are run by Jest. They're located in src/PipelineTFM/ClientApp/test/ and can be run with:\nExample :npm test.Net Backend tests\nTo launch your application's tests, run:\nExample :dotnet test --verbosity normalOthers\nCode style / formatting\nTo format the dotnet code, run\nExample :dotnet formatCode quality\nBy Script :\n\nRun Sonar in container : docker compose -f ./docker/sonar.yml up -d\n\nWait container was up Run SonarAnalysis.ps1 and go to http://localhost:9001\n\n\nManually :\n\nRun Sonar in container : docker compose -f ./docker/sonar.yml up -d\n\nInstall sonar scanner for .net :\n\n\ndotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner\n\nRun dotnet sonarscanner begin /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin /k:\"PipelineTFM\" /d:sonar.host.url=\"http://localhost:9001\" /s:\"`pwd`/SonarQube.Analysis.xml\"\n\nBuild your application : dotnet build\n\nPublish sonar results : dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login=admin /d:sonar.password=admin\n\nGo to http://localhost:9001\n\n\nMonitoring\n\nRun container (uncomment chronograf and kapacitor if you would use it): docker compose -f ./docker/monitoring.yml up -d\n\nGo to http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:8888 if you use chronograf)\n\n(Only for chronograf) Change influxdb connection string by YourApp-influxdb\n\n(Only for chronograf) Change kapacitor connection string by YourApp-kapacitor\n\n(Only for chronograf) You can now add dashboard (like docker), see your app log in Cronograf Log viewer and send alert with kapacitor\n\n\nBuild a Docker image\nYou can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on. To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:\nExample :docker build -f ./Dockerfile-Back -t pipelinetfm .Then run:\nExample :docker run -p 8080:80 pipelinetfmOr you can simply run :\nExample :docker compose -f .\\docker\\app.yml buildAnd\nExample :docker compose -f .\\docker\\app.yml up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results
